But what is a Sprint event? It\u2019s Formula 1 as we know it \u2013 but with a little less conversation, a little more action.\n\n### What is the F1 Sprint?\n\nThe Sprint is a short race. It covers 100km \u2013 about one-third of a typical Grand Prix distance \u2013 and should last about 30 minutes. This length has been chosen to encourage a race that is dynamic rather than strategic. Unlike a Grand Prix, there are no mandatory pit stops. Pit stops aren\u2019t banned but the race is too short for tyre changes to be effective.\n\n**READ MORE: Everything you need to know about F1 \u2013 Drivers, teams, cars, circuits and more**\n\nThe venues chosen for Sprint events are all tracks with great overtaking potential, picked to try and ensure the Sprint is a flat-out, aggressive melee from start to finish. Points are on offer, from eight down to one, awarded for the first eight cars to finish.\n\nF1 Explained: How a F1 Sprint weekend works - Sessions, rules and points\n\n### How does the F1 Sprint work?\n\nA Sprint weekend is different to the traditional Grand Prix weekend but it's still a three-day affair with the Grand Prix as the main event \u2013 only with even more excitement!\n\nA Formula 1 weekend is usually run (though not always) over Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Over the three days, the F1 cars appear on track for five sessions. A standard weekend has three Free Practice sessions (FP1, FP2 and FP3) lasting an hour each, followed by another hour for Qualifying \u2013 which sets the grid for the Grand Prix \u2013 and then the Grand Prix itself.\n\n**READ MORE: The beginner\u2019s guide to the F1 weekend**\n\nOn a Sprint weekend, two of the practice sessions are deleted and replaced. A Sprint Qualifying session replaces FP2 on Friday to set the grid for the Sprint. Saturday sees the Sprint itself replace FP3, before Qualifying for the Grand Prix happens as normal later that day.\n\nWith limited Free Practice running the pressure is on to get the set-up right first time, and with extra points available in a Sprint weekend it's even more intense.\n\n## Championship points awarded in an F1 Sprint\n\n| Place | Points |\n|---|---|\n| 1st | 8 |\n| 2nd | 7 |\n| 3rd | 6 |\n| 4th | 5 |\n| 5th | 4 |\n| 6th | 3 |\n| 7th | 2 |\n| 8th | 1 |\n\n### What is F1 Sprint Qualifying?\n\nSprint Qualifying takes place on Friday. Split into three stages \u2013 SQ1, SQ2 and SQ3 \u2013 lasting 12 minutes, 10 minutes and just 8 minutes respectively, the session follows a similar format to Qualifying.\n\nThe five slowest drivers are eliminated after SQ1, before five more drop out from SQ2 \u2013 thereby setting the grid positions from 20th up to 11th in the Sprint.\n\nThe 10 remaining drivers head into SQ3 to determine the top 10 grid slots, with the fastest driver starting from the front of the pack in Saturday's Sprint race.\n\n**READ MORE: The beginner\u2019s guide to the F1 calendar**\n\n### How many F1 Sprint events are there?\n\nSix circuits will host F1 Sprint weekends in 2025 \u2013 a year that marks the 75th anniversary of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship and the fifth season of the Sprint format.\n\nThe exciting 2025 F1 Sprint roster sees China and Miami on the Sprint line-up for a second consecutive year, joining Austin and Qatar which both return to host their third Sprint events. Belgium returns to the line-up for the first time since 2023, while Brazil continues its run of hosting a Sprint every year since the format began in 2021.\n\n## 2025 F1 Sprint calendar\n\n| Date | Country | Venue |\n|---|---|---|\n| March 21-23 | China | Shanghai |\n| May 2-4 | USA | Miami |\n| July 25-27 | Belgium | Spa-Francorchamps |\n| October 17-19 | USA | Austin |\n| November 7-9 | Brazil | Sao Paulo |\n| November 28-30 | Qatar | Lusail |\n\n### Why was the F1 Sprint introduced?\n\nSimply put, the Sprint weekend delivers even more bang for your buck. Many spectators enjoy simply watching the cars during a practice session, but the Sprint format guarantees meaningful action every day, with either points or grid position at stake.\n\nIt gives fans at the track the opportunity to see F1 cars absolutely flat-out on each day of the event, and gives viewers at home more racing to enjoy.\n\n**READ MORE: The beginner\u2019s guide to the F1 Drivers\u2019 Championship**\n\n### Why not have an F1 Sprint everywhere?\n\nOne of the very great virtues of Formula 1 is that each Grand Prix is distinctive. Some circuits are not a natural fit for the Sprint format, others run a higher chance of car damage and would make teams overly cautious, and some circuits are very comfortable with their traditional weekend format.\n\nBut the Sprint is a young and evolving concept, with the present arrangement still part of a learning exercise.\n\nSprint Highlights: 2024 Qatar Grand Prix\n\n### Does the Sprint influence the Grand Prix?\n\nNo\u2026 and yes. The Sprint is designed to be standalone event. Sprint Qualifying on Friday forms the grid for the Sprint on Saturday, and the result of the Sprint has no bearing on the Grand Prix\u2026 except in some very specific circumstances.\n\nThe first is a grid penalty. As with any Formula 1 race, a driver picking up a penalty in the Sprint that can\u2019t be served immediately, will serve it at their next race \u2013 usually the Grand Prix the following day.\n\n**READ MORE: The beginner\u2019s guide to the F1 Constructors\u2019 Championship**\n\nThe second is crash damage. A team is allowed to repair crash damage without penalty if they use like-for-like parts \u2013 but if a Sprint crash is sufficiently severe that the team needs to change the chassis, then the driver will automatically lose their spot on the grid and have to start the Grand Prix from the pit lane.\n\nThe F1 Sprint is an exciting 100km dash to the chequered flag with no mandatory pit stop\n\nThe bigger influence on a Grand Prix comes not from the Sprint, but rather from the limited nature of practice, with only one Free Practice session on a Sprint weekend instead of the usual three. This has a profound impact on the teams and how they operate \u2013 and not solely because they have only 60 minutes of track time to practice instead of the usual 180.\n\nOn a normal race weekend, the teams have 26 hours between the end of the first practice session and when they have to lock-in their set-up choices for Qualifying and the Grand Prix. There\u2019s a lot of analysis done at the track, and more back at the factory, where reserve drivers will be working in the simulator experimenting with different set-up options based on the telemetry flowing back from the circuit, and engineers will be mulling over the rich seam of data it generates.\n\nThe cars are also running extra electronics on Friday, with supplemental sensors and cameras, designed to maximise that data. These sensors and cameras, together with their wiring looms, are heavy \u2013 perhaps adding four or five kilos \u2013 and will be stripped out on Friday evening, getting the car down to its fighting weight ahead of Saturday\u2019s action.\n\nNone of these things are really possible on a Sprint weekend. The car goes out for the single practice session in something as close to its race spec as the team can guestimate. It\u2019s a method of operation that rewards a slick, effective trackside operation \u2013 but punishes teams if their best guesses are incorrect. Someone is always caught out, which makes Sprint weekends dramatically unpredictable.\n\nThe extra points available in the Sprint could prove crucial in a tight championship battle\n\n### How has the F1 Sprint changed?\n\nSprint weekends are a relatively modern addition to Formula 1. The 2021 calendar included three Sprint events, with the first being held as part of the British Grand Prix weekend at Silverstone. This was followed by Sprints at Monza's Italian Grand Prix and the Sao Paulo Grand Prix at Interlagos.\n\nThe process was repeated in 2022, this time with Sprints at Imola's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix weekend, the Red Bull Ring in Austria and Interlagos again, and the programme was expanded to six events in 2023, with Sprints in Azerbaijan, Austria, Belgium, Qatar, the US Grand Prix and Brazil.\n\n**READ MORE: The key differences and stand outs from the 2025 F1 calendar**\n\nThe rules have gone through something of a metamorphosis in its short history, with the initial version having the Sprint set the grid for the Grand Prix, and a token number of points on offer for the first three finishers. That changed for 2023, with more points made available in an effort to remove an element of overcautiousness that had crept into proceedings too.\n\nThe Sprint weekend format was further tweaked for 2024, with Sprint Qualifying (previously called the Shootout) moving to Friday, ahead of the Sprint itself taking place on Saturday.\n\nMax Verstappen has more F1 Sprint wins to his name than any other driver\n\n## RACE TICKETS - EMILIA-ROMAGNA\n\nDon't miss your chance to experience the picturesque Imola circuit...\n\n### YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\nNews Wolff singles out praise for Antonelli as he explains where Mercedes are struggling compared to McLaren\n\nFeatureF1 Unlocked PALMER: Why isn't it clicking yet for Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari this year?\n\nNews \u2018I\u2019m impressed, he\u2019ll be fine\u2019 \u2013 Red Bull praise Tsunoda for avoiding \u2018intimidation\u2019 of being Verstappen\u2019s team mate\n\nFeature IndyCar winner James Hinchcliffe rates Kimi Antonelli's F1 start with his quarterly report card\n\n\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://media.formula1.com/image/upload/t_16by9Centre/f_auto/q_auto/v1746531168/fom-website/2025/Miami/Hot_lap%20thumbnail_06052025.jpg]\n\"\"\"\n\n    summary = \"The F1 Sprint is a shorter race (100km) lasting about 30 minutes, designed to be dynamic with no mandatory pit stops.

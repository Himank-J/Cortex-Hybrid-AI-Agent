In April 2014, Tesla Motors\u2019 abandoned its trademark application in respect of the \u2018Model E\u2019. [ 151] There seems to have been an amicable resolution of the dispute between the car companies. In China, Tesla Motors encountered a number of troubles in respect of trademark law. [152] Professor Eric Lane from Thomas Jefferson School of Law has been following the longstanding conflict, and has provided a useful summary of the dispute: As it sought to expand into the Chinese market, the electric car maker encountered a businessman named Zhan Baosheng who owned registrations for the TESLA (or \u201cTe Si La\u201d transliterated) trademark in China in both English and Chinese. While Zhan\u2019s trademark rights initially blocked Tesla from using the mark there, in early 2014 the company announced that **it had resolved the** **matter** though a court decision granting it the right to use the TESLA mark in China.

He... demanded that Tesla stop all sales and marketing activities in China, shut down showrooms and charging facilities, and pay him 23.9 million yuan ($3.85 million) in compensation. It appears that Zhan finally got his pay day. Tesla recently said it resolved the dispute \u2013 this time via a direct settlement with Zhan\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_20]\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\"rather than relying on the Chinese court system. [153] ## In August 2014, Tesla Motors finally reached a settlement to end the China trademark dispute. There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names.

[158] In addition to trademark law, Tesla Motors has also been involved in unsuccessful defamation litigation in the United Kingdom against BBC over disparaging reviews of the performance of its cars on the show Top Gear. [159] Tesla Motors complained about Jeremy Clarkson, saying: \u2018Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: \u2018In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms\u2019. [161] He commented: \u2018Moreover, on the basis of the material currently before the court I do not think that there is any real prospect of Tesla\\'s being able to demonstrate at trial that it has suffered any quantifiable loss by reason of any of the actionable statements.\u2019 [162] http://www.afr.com/p/marketing/chinese _ trademark _ squatters _ have _ ABq1XbD3mSTQMiWicm38PO and Kim Lester, \u2018Penfolds, Tesla, and Apple: Trade Mark Squatting in China\u2019, Drive, ABC 666 Radio, 16 July 2014. 158 Jess Collen, \u2018Tesla\\'s Trademark Problems In China Are Hardly Electrifying News\u2019, *Forbes*, 7 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/new\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_21]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\"worked hard to obtain them.

Elon Musk noted that Tesla Motors, at first, sought to build a significant patent portfolio: \u2018At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla\u2019. [36] The company developed a significant portfolio of patents in respect of electric cars and associated infrastructure. Elon Musk observed, though, that such an assumption was incorrect: \u2018The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn\u2019t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.\u2019 [37] He lamented: \u2018At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited range in limited volume\u2019. [38] Musk observed that some automobile manufacturers produced \u2018no zero emission cars at all\u2019. [39] Tesla Motors has been involved in a number of legal skirmishes in respect of intellectual property. In a 2013 dispute, Tesla Motors was involved in a skirmish with pointSET. [40] The dispute involved a battle over the remote control of temperature in cars. As Eric Loveday: 36 Ibid. 37 Ibid. 38 Ibid. 39 Ibid. 40 Michelle Jones, \u2018Tesla Strikes First Legal Blow in Patent Dispute\u2019, Value Walk, 14 June 2013, - http://www.valuewalk.com/2013/06/tesla patent dispute/ 14 ----- The Tesla Model S features a system that allows owners to remotely access the climate control settings. This system essentially allows owner to pre-cool or pre-heat the cabin of a plugged-in Model S. Of course, this is a feature that we\u2019re sure all Model S owners use on almost a daily basis. However, there may be an issue that could prevent Model S owners from accessing this feature in the future. It seems Tesla\u2019s remote access system may infringe upon a patent held by pointSET. [41] ## On the 30th April 2013, an attorney for pointSET sent a letter to Tesla Motors, alleging that \u2018Tesla induces infringement of claim 6 of United States Patent No. 7,379,541.\u2019 [42] The patent concerned a \u2018method and apparatus for setting programmable features of a motor vehicle.\u2019 43 The letter stated that \u2018pointSET is offering a one-time, fully-paid licensing flat fee of $500,000\\' that \u2018will cover both past and future use of the technology.\u2019 [44] In response, Tesla Motors sought a declaratory judgment of patent\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_6]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\"Ibid. 25 Maulin Shah, \u2018Auto Industry May Ignore Tesla\u2019s Patents\u2019, Enivsion IP, 26 June 2014, http://envisionip.com/blog/2014/06/26/auto - industry - may - ignore - tesla - patents/ 26 Ibid. 27 Ibid. 10 ----- **Image:** Here\\'s the text from the image: TESLA PATENT INOGRAPHIC DELTIGHT.COM \u2756 ENVISIONIP.COM 172 ISSUED PATENTS 123 PUBLISHED APPLICATIONS BATTERY & CHARGING 28 PATENTS 18 APPLICATIONS MOTOR & DRIVE CONTROL 24 PATENTS 15 APPLICATIONS FRAME & CHASSIS 16 PATENTS 10 APPLICATIONS DOORS & LATCHES 13 PATENTS 9 APPLICATIONS HVAC 11 PATENTS 7 APPLICATIONS MISCELLANEOUS 9 PATENTS 4 APPLICATIONS SUNROOF 6 PATENTS 3 APPLICATIONS USER INTERFACE & MULTIMEDIA 5 PATENTS 2 APPLICATIONS DESIGN 4 PATENTS 1 APPLICATIONS ACTIVITY OVER TIME PATENT PUBLICATIONS PER YEAR 2005 0 2 4 9 35 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 36 2012 61 2013 109 2014 39 FOUNDER AND TOP INVENTORS BY NUMBER OF PATENTS TAHO YIFAN 16 KURT RUSSELL HELTS 20 WESTON ARTHUR HERMAN 13 FRANCISCO LEPORT 12 ELON MUSK (FOUNDER) 3 PETER DORE RUNNISON 15 11 ----- **Image:** PATENTS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY MAJOR AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS GM 686 TOYOTA 663 HONDA 662 FORD 466 NISSAN 238 DAIMLER 194 HYUNDAI 109 BMW 41 KIA 27 MAZDA 24 AN INFOGRAPHIC BY DELTASIGHT.COM & ENVISIONIP.COM ## The company emphasized that \u2018the protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities.\u2019 [28] However, Tesla Motors recognised that \u2018such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons.\u2019 [29] The company was conscious that \u2018our patents, if issued, may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights.\u2019 Tesla Motors recognised that \u2018the patents we have been granted may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented because of the pre-existence of similar patented or unpatented intellectual 28 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 29 Ibid. 12 ----- ## property rights or for other reasons.\u2019 [30] The company also noted that \u2018the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable.\u2019 [31] Tesla Motors was also aware that \u2018current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our patents.\u2019 [32] Tesla Motors admitted that \u2018The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain\u2019. [33] The company was also conscious: \u2018In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\u2019 [34] Such reservations are an important context for the announcement in 2014. In his blog post in 2014, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors discussed his growing disenchantment with the patent system: When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were a good thing and\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_5]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\"Patent Litigation and Patent Assertion Entities on Entrepreneurial Activity\u2019 [PDF].

[58] He wondered: \u2018Just how legally enforceable would Tesla\u2019s declaration be? That is, if a technologist practiced one of Tesla\u2019s patents, would they really be free from liability?\u2019 Greenberg ponders whether the statements by Musk by themselves would be sufficient: Sure, Tesla may be estopped from enforcing its patents\u2014though estoppel requires reasonable reliance and this announcement is so vague that it\u2019s difficult to imagine the reliance that would be reasonable\u2014 and Tesla isn\u2019t in the patent trolling business anyway. (Sorry, patent-assertion-entity business). But what if Tesla sold its patents or went bankrupt. Could a third party not enforce the patents? If it could, patents promised to be open source would seem a rich market for PAEs. Tesla is not to first to pledge its patents as open source. In fact, as Clark Asay pointed out, IBM has already been accused of reneging the promise. (See: \u201cIBM now appears to be claiming the right to nullify the 2005 pledge at its sole discretion, rendering it a meaningless confidence trick.\u201d) The questions raised by the Tesla announcement are, thus, not new. And, given enough time, courts will have to answer them. [59] ## There has been similar issues arising in the context of battles over gene patents \u2013 there has been much discussion as to whether Genetic Technologies Limited would be estopped from taking action, in light of its statements.

[152] Professor Eric Lane from Thomas Jefferson School of Law has been following the longstanding conflict, and has provided a useful summary of the dispute: As it sought to expand into the Chinese market, the electric car maker encountered a businessman named Zhan Baosheng who owned registrations for the TESLA (or \u201cTe Si La\u201d transliterated) trademark in China in both English and Chinese. While Zhan\u2019s trademark rights initially blocked Tesla from using the mark there, in early 2014 the company announced that **it had resolved the** **matter** though a court decision granting it the right to use the TESLA mark in China. So Tesla seemed 150 Mandour & Associates, \u2018Ford and Tesla Clash Over \u201cModel E\u201d Trademark\u2019, Orange County Trademark Attorney Blog, 10 January 2014, http://www.orangecountytrademarkattorney.pro/2014/01/ford - and tesla - clash - over - model - e - trademark.html 151 Kirsten Korosec, \u2018Tesla Drops Model E Trademark, but Ford Hangs On\u2019, *Fortune*, 7 May 2014, http://fortune.com/2014/05/07/tesla - drops - model - e - trademark - but - ford - hangs - on/ 152 Tian Ying and Alan Ohnsman, \u2018Bloomberg, Tesla Sued by Businessman Claiming China Trademark Right\u2019, Bloomberg, 9 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014 - 07 - 07/tesla - sued - in - china - for trademark - infringement.html 39 ----- to be in the clear until Mr. Zhan, apparently unsatisfied, **decided to sue Tesla for trademark** **infringement** . He... demanded that Tesla stop all sales and marketing activities in China, shut down showrooms and charging facilities, and pay him 23.9 million yuan ($3.85 million) in compensation. It appears that Zhan finally got his pay day. Tesla recently said it resolved the dispute \u2013 this time via a direct settlement with Zhan\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_20]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"rather than relying on the Chinese court system. [153] ## In August 2014, Tesla Motors finally reached a settlement to end the China trademark dispute. There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names. There have been similar battles over foreign trademarks in China \u2013 with the United States information technology company, Apple and the Australian wine-maker, Penfolds.

[158] In addition to trademark law, Tesla Motors has also been involved in unsuccessful defamation litigation in the United Kingdom against BBC over disparaging reviews of the performance of its cars on the show Top Gear. [159] Tesla Motors complained about Jeremy Clarkson, saying: \u2018Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: \u2018In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms\u2019. [161] He commented: \u2018Moreover, on the basis of the material currently before the court I do not think that there is any real prospect of Tesla's being able to demonstrate at trial that it has suffered any quantifiable loss by reason of any of the actionable statements.\u2019 [162] http://www.afr.com/p/marketing/chinese _ trademark _ squatters _ have _ ABq1XbD3mSTQMiWicm38PO and Kim Lester, \u2018Penfolds, Tesla, and Apple: Trade Mark Squatting in China\u2019, Drive, ABC 666 Radio, 16 July 2014. 158 Jess Collen, \u2018Tesla's Trademark Problems In China Are Hardly Electrifying News\u2019, *Forbes*, 7 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/new\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_21]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"worked hard to obtain them. And maybe they were good long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors.

Elon Musk noted that Tesla Motors, at first, sought to build a significant patent portfolio: \u2018At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla\u2019. [36] The company developed a significant portfolio of patents in respect of electric cars and associated infrastructure. Elon Musk observed, though, that such an assumption was incorrect: \u2018The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn\u2019t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.\u2019 [37] He lamented: \u2018At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited range in limited volume\u2019. [38] Musk observed that some automobile manufacturers produced \u2018no zero emission cars at all\u2019. [39] Tesla Motors has been involved in a number of legal skirmishes in respect of intellectual property. In a 2013 dispute, Tesla Motors was involved in a skirmish with pointSET. [40] The dispute involved a battle over the remote control of temperature in cars. As Eric Loveday: 36 Ibid. 37 Ibid. 38 Ibid. 39 Ibid. 40 Michelle Jones, \u2018Tesla Strikes First Legal Blow in Patent Dispute\u2019, Value Walk, 14 June 2013, - http://www.valuewalk.com/2013/06/tesla patent dispute/ 14 ----- The Tesla Model S features a system that allows owners to remotely access the climate control settings. This system essentially allows owner to pre-cool or pre-heat the cabin of a plugged-in Model S. Of course, this is a feature that we\u2019re sure all Model S owners use on almost a daily basis. However, there may be an issue that could prevent Model S owners from accessing this feature in the future. It seems Tesla\u2019s remote access system may infringe upon a patent held by pointSET. [41] ## On the 30th April 2013, an attorney for pointSET sent a letter to Tesla Motors, alleging that \u2018Tesla induces infringement of claim 6 of United States Patent No. 7,379,541.\u2019 [42] The patent concerned a \u2018method and apparatus for setting programmable features of a motor vehicle.\u2019 43 The letter stated that \u2018pointSET is offering a one-time, fully-paid licensing flat fee of $500,000' that \u2018will cover both past and future use of the technology.\u2019 [44] In response, Tesla Motors sought a declaratory judgment of patent\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_6]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"Ibid. 25 Maulin Shah, \u2018Auto Industry May Ignore Tesla\u2019s Patents\u2019, Enivsion IP, 26 June 2014, http://envisionip.com/blog/2014/06/26/auto - industry - may - ignore - tesla - patents/ 26 Ibid. 27 Ibid. 10 ----- **Image:** Here's the text from the image: TESLA PATENT INOGRAPHIC DELTIGHT.COM \u2756 ENVISIONIP.COM 172 ISSUED PATENTS 123 PUBLISHED APPLICATIONS BATTERY & CHARGING 28 PATENTS 18 APPLICATIONS MOTOR & DRIVE CONTROL 24 PATENTS 15 APPLICATIONS FRAME & CHASSIS 16 PATENTS 10 APPLICATIONS DOORS & LATCHES 13 PATENTS 9 APPLICATIONS HVAC 11 PATENTS 7 APPLICATIONS MISCELLANEOUS 9 PATENTS 4 APPLICATIONS SUNROOF 6 PATENTS 3 APPLICATIONS USER INTERFACE & MULTIMEDIA 5 PATENTS 2 APPLICATIONS DESIGN 4 PATENTS 1 APPLICATIONS ACTIVITY OVER TIME PATENT PUBLICATIONS PER YEAR 2005 0 2 4 9 35 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 36 2012 61 2013 109 2014 39 FOUNDER AND TOP INVENTORS BY NUMBER OF PATENTS TAHO YIFAN 16 KURT RUSSELL HELTS 20 WESTON ARTHUR HERMAN 13 FRANCISCO LEPORT 12 ELON MUSK (FOUNDER) 3 PETER DORE RUNNISON 15 11 ----- **Image:** PATENTS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY MAJOR AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS GM 686 TOYOTA 663 HONDA 662 FORD 466 NISSAN 238 DAIMLER 194 HYUNDAI 109 BMW 41 KIA 27 MAZDA 24 AN INFOGRAPHIC BY DELTASIGHT.COM & ENVISIONIP.COM ## The company emphasized that \u2018the protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities.\u2019 [28] However, Tesla Motors recognised that \u2018such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons.\u2019 [29] The company was conscious that \u2018our patents, if issued, may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights.\u2019 Tesla Motors recognised that \u2018the patents we have been granted may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented because of the pre-existence of similar patented or unpatented intellectual 28 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 29 Ibid. 12 ----- ## property rights or for other reasons.\u2019 [30] The company also noted that \u2018the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable.\u2019 [31] Tesla Motors was also aware that \u2018current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our patents.\u2019 [32] Tesla Motors admitted that \u2018The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain\u2019. [33] The company was also conscious: \u2018In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\u2019 [34] Such reservations are an important context for the announcement in 2014. In his blog post in 2014, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors discussed his growing disenchantment with the patent system: When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were a good thing and\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_5]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"Patent Litigation and Patent Assertion Entities on Entrepreneurial Activity\u2019 [PDF].

[58] He wondered: \u2018Just how legally enforceable would Tesla\u2019s declaration be? That is, if a technologist practiced one of Tesla\u2019s patents, would they really be free from liability?\u2019 Greenberg ponders whether the statements by Musk by themselves would be sufficient: Sure, Tesla may be estopped from enforcing its patents\u2014though estoppel requires reasonable reliance and this announcement is so vague that it\u2019s difficult to imagine the reliance that would be reasonable\u2014 and Tesla isn\u2019t in the patent trolling business anyway. (Sorry, patent-assertion-entity business). But what if Tesla sold its patents or went bankrupt. Could a third party not enforce the patents? If it could, patents promised to be open source would seem a rich market for PAEs. Tesla is not to first to pledge its patents as open source. In fact, as Clark Asay pointed out, IBM has already been accused of reneging the promise. (See: \u201cIBM now appears to be claiming the right to nullify the 2005 pledge at its sole discretion, rendering it a meaningless confidence trick.\u201d) The questions raised by the Tesla announcement are, thus, not new. And, given enough time, courts will have to answer them. [59] ## There has been similar issues arising in the context of battles over gene patents \u2013 there has been much discussion as to whether Genetic Technologies Limited would be estopped from taking action, in light of its statements.
